   * character would also delete committed text.
   * Theoretically these events could be filtered out before being handled,
   * however only the IME knows which keys it consumes and this isn't exposed by any API,
   * so operators must skip them while composing.
   * Canceling instead of passing the event through prevents other key-map items from matching it.

   * - #WM_operator_IME_edit_maybe
   * - #WM_operator_IME_insert_maybe
